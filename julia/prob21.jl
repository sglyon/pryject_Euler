Project Euler Problem 21

Problem text:

    Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less
    than n which divide evenly into n). If d(a) = b and d(b) = a,
    where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and
    b are called amicable numbers. For example, the proper divisors of
    220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220)
    = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284)
    = 220. Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
